Sunburnt
========

This is a fork of Toby White's <toby@timetric.com> sunburnt, updated for Python 3.
This is mostly useful as a library that supports very old versions of Solr,
while supporting python 3.

Sunburnt is a Python-based interface for working with the `Apache Solr
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_ search engine.

It was written by Toby White <toby@timetric.com> for use in the `Timetric
platform <http://timetric.com>`_.

It's tested with Solr 1.4.1 and 3.1; previous versions were known to work
with 1.3 and 1.4 as well.
